# IoT-Weather-Station-using-Tinkercad-and-ThingSpeak
A Tinkercad projet for measuring weather details using sensors like temperature, photoresistor and gas sensor and sending it on ThingSpeak server using POST API.

## Sensors Used
  1. TMP36
  2. Photoresistor
  3. Gas Sensor

## Other Components
  1. Arduino UNO
  2. WI-Fi Module ESP8266
  3. LCD 16x2 Display

## Communication Protocols
  1. Wi-Fi
  2. Using TCP/IP
  3. Transfer data to remote server
  4. Write API of ThingSpeak for transferring data 

## ThingSpeak Steup
https://thingspeak.com/

You need to signup to the above website linke and create a channel there. You have to create 3 fields there of temperarure, light and gas sensor data.
Copy the Write API from thingSpeak and replace it in the Tinkercad code.
